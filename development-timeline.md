## Development Phases and Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Requirements and Design (2–3 weeks)**
   - Finalize detailed specifications and create wireframes.
   - Choose the open source models (e.g., Llama 2, Mozilla TTS) and design system architecture.

2. **Phase 2: Prototyping (4–6 weeks)**
   - Develop a prototype chat listener using tmi.js and Twitch API.
   - Set up an initial LLM dialogue engine with Llama 2 or GPT4All and test using vLLM.
   - Prototype TTS conversion with Mozilla/Coqui TTS.
   - Build a minimal Godot-based avatar overlay.

3. **Phase 3: Core Development (8–12 weeks)**
   - Expand backend services for dialogue generation, context management (with FAISS), and moderation.
   - Develop a full-featured streamer dashboard using React/Next.js.
   - Integrate the TTS engine and avatar system into OBS using obs-websocket.
   - Implement real-time analytics and monitoring.

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (4–6 weeks)**
   - Perform unit, integration, and load testing to ensure low latency.
   - Optimize AI inference pipelines and TTS conversion for real-time performance.
   - Test full integration with Twitch, OBS, and the dashboard.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment and Beta Launch (2–3 weeks)**
   - Containerize services with Docker and deploy using Kubernetes.
   - Launch a beta version to a select group of streamers.
   - Collect feedback and iterate on performance and features.

6. **Phase 6: Full Launch and Ongoing Development**
   - Roll out to a wider audience.
   - Continue monitoring, update features, and foster community engagement for future improvements.
