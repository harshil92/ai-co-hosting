## Requirements

### A. Functional Requirements

1. **Real-Time Chat Integration:**
   - **Twitch API & tmi.js:**  
     Use Twitch’s official API together with open source libraries like [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js) to receive and parse live chat messages.
   - **Chat Parsing & Sentiment Analysis:**  
     Integrate NLP pipelines (using Python libraries such as spaCy or Hugging Face’s Transformers) to understand viewer input.

2. **Dynamic Dialogue Generation:**
   - **Open Source LLM Engine:**  
     Use open source models such as [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) or [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/) with fast inference engines like [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) to generate context-aware responses.
   - **Context & State Management:**  
     Implement a context management module that uses lightweight vector stores (e.g., [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
   - **Mozilla TTS / Coqui TTS:**  
     Leverage open source TTS engines such as [Mozilla TTS](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS) or [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) to convert text responses into natural-sounding speech with options for voice modulation.

4. **Avatar and Visual Representation:**
   - **Open Source Animation Engine:**  
     Use [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) for rendering 2D avatars and interactive overlays. Godot’s open source nature makes it ideal for creating a customizable virtual co-host.
   - **Avatar Customization:**  
     Develop a modular system to update avatar expressions and animations in response to dialogue (possibly integrating open libraries like [OpenToonz](https://opentoonz.github.io/e/index.html) for 2D animation if needed).

5. **Streaming Integration:**
   - **OBS Integration:**  
     OBS is open source and widely used by streamers. Develop plugins or use OBS’s WebSocket API (via [obs-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket)) to trigger visual overlays and audio events.
   - **Server-Sent Events (SSE) / WebSockets:**  
     Use SSE or WebSockets for low-latency delivery of the co-host’s responses to the streaming overlay and dashboard.

6. **Administrative and Moderation Tools:**
   - **Content Moderation:**  
     Integrate open source moderation tools and customizable filters (using regular expressions or community libraries) to ensure dialogue remains appropriate.
   - **Analytics Dashboard:**  
     Create a dashboard using open source web frameworks to display engagement metrics, chat sentiment, and system performance.

### B. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance and Scalability:**
   - **Low Latency:**  
     Optimize the LLM inference and TTS pipeline (e.g., using vLLM and efficient TTS models) to target response times under 1–2 seconds.
   - **Scalability:**  
     Design a microservices-based backend with container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes) that scales with the number of concurrent users.

2. **Reliability and Uptime:**
   - **Monitoring & Logging:**  
     Use open source monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and logging (ELK stack) tools to track system health and performance.
   - **Fault Tolerance:**  
     Implement redundancy in key services and automated failover processes.

3. **Security and Privacy:**
   - **Data Protection:**  
     Secure all API tokens and viewer data. Use HTTPS and industry-standard encryption.
   - **Access Control:**  
     Apply authentication (e.g., OAuth2 for the dashboard) and role-based access control for administrative features.

4. **Extensibility:**
   - **Modular Plugin Architecture:**  
     Design the system so that additional modules (e.g., new language models, alternative TTS engines, additional avatar modules) can be plugged in with minimal rework.
   - **Open Source Collaboration:**  
     Ensure the codebase is well documented and hosted (e.g., on GitHub) to encourage community contributions.
